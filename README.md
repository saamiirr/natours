# Natours

I built this application while studying [Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2024](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/) on Udemy.
This project allows users to view tours, book them, review, sign up, log in, logout, update, and reset password. I did **NOT** build the UI for this application but I built the API and server side rendering website.
This project is deployed on a server, click [here](https://natours-ssro.onrender.com/) to visit.
